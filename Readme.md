# Advent of Code Collection

This is my collection of *Advent of Code* challenges. They are not completed since at one point my knowledge and programming skill is limited for many advent of code tasks. 

I do advent of code just for fun and try to practice my programming skills. Feel free to check my advent of code years!

## File Structure Script

I also re-designed my file-structure python scrypt, which I made for advent of code 2021. It is now much simpler and shorter. Feel free to use it for your own file-structure creation for advent of code!

**File-Strucutre:**

```txt
AoC-<year>
|---Readme.md                   # General Readme
|---src/                        # Source-Folder for all days
    |---Day n
        |---examples/           # Directory for example inputs
            |---example1.txt
            |---example2.txt
        |---tasks/              # Directory for task inputs
            |---task1.txt
            |---task2.txt
        |---main.py             # Main python file
        |---test.py             # Test python file
        |---Task.md             # The task copied from advent of code
